# FlashNote-csfs1000
 A note-taking app with flashcard functionality 

## User Stories

> As a psychology student, I want to be able to make well organized notes, generate flashcards easily, and test myself in one app. 

> As a Spanish language learner, I want to make flashcards where on one side there is a Spanish word or phrase, and on the other side is the English translation. I want these flashcards to be reversible so if I am given an English word, I have to translate into Spanish and vice versa. 

> As an anatomy and physiology student, I want to make a flashcard with an anatomy diagram with the labels blocked out, and then I want to test myself on the diagram one label at a time.

> As a French language instructor, I want to create notes and flashcards that are relevant to my course, and share them with my students as a learning resource.

## Figma Design

Here is the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/qLDlZ9jFJyVfCwlUggwRTH/FlashNote-Project?t=dlnkvsX8MIRRQTuq-1) for the project. It has limited interactivity and the design for each device size is on a separate page.
