# FlashNote-csfs1000
 A note-taking app with flashcard functionality 

## User Stories

> As a psychology student, I want to be able to make well organized notes, generate flashcards easily, and test myself in one app. 

> As a Spanish language learner, I want to make flashcards where on one side there is a Spanish word or phrase, and on the other side is the English translation. I want these flashcards to be reversible so if I am given an English word, I have to translate into Spanish and vice versa. 

> As a medical student, I want to make a flashcard with an anatomy diagram with the labels blocked out, and then I want to test myself on the diagram one label at a time.

> As a French language instructor, I want to create notes and flashcards that are relevant to my course, and share them with my students as a learning resource.

> As a learning enthusiast, I want to take notes and make flashcards on the subjects that I'm learning, and share them with the world.

## Functionality

FlashNote is a note-taking and flashcard app that makes use of learning techniques such as [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect) and [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Apart from just taking notes, a user can:
- generate standard flashcards with the question on the front and the answer on the back
- generate reversible flashcards, where either the front or the back of the card can be shown as the question
- generate [cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test) flashcards, which contain 'fill in the blank' style questions
- generate image occulsion flashcards like the example shown below
